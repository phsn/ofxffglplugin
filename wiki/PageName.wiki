*openFrameworks addon for creating FFGL ( FreeFrame 1.5 ) plugins*

_At the moment XCode 3.0 and Visual Studio Express 2008 projects are present._

To get the Visual Studio Express version to compile it was necessary to make a slight modification to the code in FFGL ( _FFGLPluginInfo.h_ )
so the version included with this addon is not the official FFGL version.

The windows version of openFrameworks needs to be linked with some dll's that will be automatically copyed in the bin folder after compilation.
To get the plugin to work these .dll's must be copyed either into the SYSTEM32 folder or in the same folder as the plugin.

_Mouse and keyboard callbacks are not supported._

_Color parameters are not yet supported, but you can easily use float instead._


*To create your own ofFFGL project:*

copy one of the example projects.

in main.cpp:
  *In the DEFINE_FFGL_PLUGIN macro 
  change testApp with your App class name, if it is different.
  And set min and max input textures.
	
  *Customize the CFFGLPluginInfo struct:
{{{
static CFFGLPluginInfo PluginInfo (
	createPluginInstance,					// * Default creation method ( created with the DEFINE_FFGL_PLUGIN macro )
	
	"OFEX",									// Plugin unique ID. This must be different for every plugin and 4 characters long.
	"OFTest1",								// Plugin name
	
	1,										// * API major version number
	500,									// * API minor version number
	1,										// Plugin major version number
	000,									// Plugin minor version number
	
	FF_SOURCE,								// Plugin type FF_SOURCE or FF_EFFECT ( filters ) 
	"Test OpenFrameworks Plugin",			// Plugin description
	"by Daniel Berio - www.enist.org"		// About
	
	,0										// *
	,NULL									// *
);
}}}

_It is important that every plugin has a 4 character identifier. This must be different for every FFGL plugin._
